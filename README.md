# PHP-Lecture
### by: _Matthew Dahl_

This is a lecture for __Web Development II__ at Clover Park Technical College. The aim is to demonstrate the difference between _procedural_ and _object oriented_ `PHP`. The target is students who have completed __Web Development I__, __Programming 101__ and are already familiar with basic programming concepts as well as `HTML`, `CSS` and `PHP`.

We are using a simple single page `PHP` application that rolls dice. This allows us to easily see how objects can both be created singly and contain other objects as well. The end result is an extremely modular set of dice that could be called up in any application in the future and work with minimal `PHP` written in the markup document.

#### Dice Demonstration:
- [Procedural Method][proc-method]
- [Object Oriented Method][oop-method]


[proc-method]: /procedural-method "Procedural Programming"
[oop-method]: /oop-method "Object Oriented Programming"
